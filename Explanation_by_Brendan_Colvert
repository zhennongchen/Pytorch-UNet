Pytorch is a simpler backend for model building.
It uses "Modules" to build a model.
for example, in CNN, it sequentially put modules like 2D convolution, activation, maxpooling to make the CNN.

The scripts can be run in octomore if use GPU. 
how to open the jupyter notebook in octomore: https://ljvmiranda921.github.io/notebook/2018/01/31/running-a-jupyter-notebook/

In the folder unet:
unet_parts.py defines all the modules
unet_model.py puts the modules together for the model

The lastest version of model training is train_full_model_spine.ipynb, which we should mainly focus on.
